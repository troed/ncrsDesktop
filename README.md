# ncRS Desktop client
Unofficial Nextcloud Desktop client with proper VFS support on *nix. Rewritten from scratch in rust.
Designed to perform well in installations with a very large amount of shared files/media etc (where cloud storage >> local storage), as well as in a smaller cloud.

## Feature comparison:
| Feature                   | Nextcloud Desktop | GNOME Integration/GVfs | ncRS |
| :------------------------ | :---------------- | :--------------------- | :--- |
| Real Virtual Filesystem             | ❌ (Experimental, bad approach which doesn't work with shell/file pickers etc)                | ✅ (remote only)                     | ✅   |
| Streaming Download Support (play large 4K videos at network-rate)         | ❌ | ❌ (yes, but throughput is lower) | ✅ |
| Nextcloud Notifications         | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Nautilus integration: syncing/downloaded/shared    | ✅ (partial)                | N/A since it's only online                    | ✅   |
| Instant local access      | ✅                | ❌                     | ✅   |
| Fast time to first use (usable right after setup, no bulk download first) | ❌ (must fully download the entire selected folder tree before anything is usable) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Zero-copy cache reads (kernel serves the cached file directly, no extra copy through the app) | ✅ (not really a fair comparison — it isn't virtual, so *every* file is a permanent full local copy, always "cached" by definition) | ❌ | ✅ (Linux 6.9+, via kernel FUSE passthrough) |
| Nextcloud-generated thumbnails         | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (even for RAW images!) |
| Local cached file pruning      | ❌                | ❌                     | ✅ intelligently keeps local copies of often-used files  |
| Dynamically cache files/keep part locally | ❌                | ❌ (No internet = no files) | ✅   |
| No path conflicts | ❌ (may emit sync errors)               | ✅ | ✅ No dumb 'Some files could not be synced' |
| Maps nextcloud permissions to filesystem permissions      | ❌                | ❌ (will error, but doesn't first display it to the user)                    | ✅   |

| Syncing multiple OS paths -> different folders within Nextcloud     | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ (everything mounted under the Nextcloud path) |


## Server tips
Server-side recommendation: If you have shell access to your Nextcloud server, you shall enable background thumbnail pre-generation with occ preview:pre-generate. 

This makes the server generate thumbnails during idle time rather than on-demand, which would eliminate the congestion entirely for directories that have been indexed.

We avoid local thumbnail generation so that entire files don't have to be downloaded for the local thumbnailer to run.

## Note for coding agent users (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, …)
Coding agents are not polite to network filesystems. To find a binary or a config file they happily run `find / -name protoc`, `rg pattern ~` or `du -sh ~/*`. Those commands walk into `~/Nextcloud`, and every directory they enter becomes a WebDAV request to your server. Claude Code does not kill a long command: after 2 minutes it moves it to the background, where a single `find /` can crawl your whole Nextcloud for hours (we measured ~20 listings/s and 20,000 folders in 20 minutes). Such a crawl can overload the server into returning `500` errors. ncrs defends itself: it backs off from a failing server, and it paces any single program that crawls folders it hasn't cached (Settings → Performance → *Slow down folder crawlers*, on by default at 10 folders/s). Still, the cheapest request is the one never sent.

Keep agents off the mount by adding the bundled guard hook to your **user-level** Claude Code settings. It refuses `find`/`rg`/`grep -r`/`du`/`fd`/`ls -R`/`tree` walks, and Glob/Grep tool searches, that would descend into the mount from `/` or `~`. It allows them when they stay on one filesystem (`find / -xdev`, `rg --one-file-system`, `du -x`), prune the mount, or target a narrower directory. The refusal message tells the agent how to rewrite the command.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/hooks
curl -fsSLo ~/.claude/hooks/block-root-walks.py \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgon/ncrsDesktop/master/scripts/claude-code/block-root-walks.py
# Merge the hook into ~/.claude/settings.json (keeps your existing settings):
jq '.hooks.PreToolUse = ((.hooks.PreToolUse // []) + [{"matcher":"Bash|Glob|Grep","hooks":[{"type":"command","command":"python3 ~/.claude/hooks/block-root-walks.py","timeout":10}]}])' \
  ~/.claude/settings.json > /tmp/claude-settings.json && mv /tmp/claude-settings.json ~/.claude/settings.json
```

The hook guards `~/Nextcloud` by default. To guard other mount points, set `NCRS_WALK_GUARD_MOUNTS=/path/one:/path/two`. Also consider adding a line like "never recurse from `/` or `~` without `-xdev`; `~/Nextcloud` is a network mount" to your `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Other agents need their own equivalent, such as a command deny-list or rules file.

## Usage
Download and install the .deb file from the [/releases](https://github.com/rgon/ncrsDesktop/releases) page. You may simply double click the `.deb` to install it with your OS's package manager.

### openSUSE (Leap 16, Slowroll, Tumbleweed)
The `.rpm` packages the same client as the `.deb` (GUI tray app, daemon, GNOME search provider, CR3 thumbnailer, Nautilus extension, and the KF6 Dolphin plugin + ServiceMenu). It is built from source, so the build host needs `cargo`, `pnpm`, `rpm-build` and every `BuildRequires` listed in `packaging/ncrs.spec`. A bare `opensuse/tumbleweed` container does *not* have those installed — install them first (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` has the exact `zypper install` line CI uses):

```sh
bash scripts/build-rpm.sh            # -> dist/ncrs-<version>-0.<arch>.rpm
```

On a host whose toolchain is not installed as RPMs — **rustup**'s `cargo`, or an `npm`-installed `pnpm` — `rpmbuild` cannot see them and stops with `Failed build dependencies:`. Install the `-devel` packages the spec needs (`fuse3-devel`, `gtk3-devel`, `webkit2gtk3-devel`, `kf6-kio-devel`, `librsvg-devel`, plus `cmake`/`qt6-base-devel`/`kf6-kcoreaddons-devel`/`kf6-extra-cmake-modules`), then build with `--nodeps`:

```sh
bash scripts/build-rpm.sh --nodeps
```

`--nodeps` skips only rpmbuild's `BuildRequires` check; the libraries must still be present or the compile fails. CI installs the distro toolchain and does not use it.

Install it. The locally built artifact is not GPG-signed, so `zypper` warns that the package is unsigned and prompts for confirmation; pass `--allow-unsigned-rpm` to skip that prompt:
```sh
sudo zypper in ./dist/ncrs-*.rpm
```

The GUI tray app autostarts at login via `/etc/xdg/autostart/es.rgon.ncrs.desktop`, exactly like the `.deb`. The **headless alternative** is `systemctl --user enable --now ncrs.service`, which runs the daemon without the GUI; the two coexist (see *Provisioning* below).

The Nautilus sync-state emblems need `python-nautilus`. On Leap 16 it may not be in the OSS repo — enable the Package Hub for your release and install it from there if `zypper` cannot find it. The Dolphin integration ships inside the RPM, so it needs nothing extra.

On **openSUSE Leap 16** the tray icon also needs `libayatana-appindicator3-1`, which is Package Hub–only (not in OSS/Update). Enable the Package Hub and install it to get the tray icon. It is a `Recommends` on Leap 16, not a hard dependency, so a stock install succeeds without it and the GUI runs — you just get no tray icon.

### First-time setup
You may directly set it up using the GUI, following the interactive 'Authorize Device'-type login from the web browser. This issues a revocable Nextcloud app password, which is saved in your OS keyring (GNOME Keyring/KWallet).

The recommended configuration options are the defaults. However, you may modify them via the cogwheel icon in the application menu.

## Non-interactive setup
`ncrs-gui` writes its configuration to a yaml file, for easy view and editing.

You may edit this file to configure it non-interactively, which is especially useful for remote/fleet deployment.

**Create the config file** — run the daemon once to generate the skeleton, then fill it in:
```sh
cargo run -p ncrs_core        # exits immediately, writes ~/.config/ncrs/config.yaml
nano ~/.config/ncrs/config.yaml
```

The file looks like this. You shall use an [app password](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/user_manual/en/session_management.html#managing-devices) rather than the user's main password:
```yaml
url: https://cloud.example.com/remote.php/dav/files/YOUR_USERNAME/
username: youruser
password: xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx   # app password (optional) or fetched/saved from the system keyring
mount_point: /home/<user>/ncrs
user: youruser
```

### Provisioning (corporate / multi-user)

The `.deb` (built by `scripts/build-deb.sh` will allow fleet config. For 

- **Config is per-user** at `~/.config/ncrs/config.yaml` (XDG; there is no system-wide config). A template ships at `/usr/share/doc/ncrs/config.yaml.example`, or generate one with `ncrs --print-default-config`.
- **Push per-user config files** with your config-management tool (e.g. Ansible `template` to each user's `~/.config/ncrs/config.yaml`). You may pre-fill `/etc/skel/.config/ncrs/config.yaml` so new accounts start provisioned. If setting the password on the config file, always use per-user [app passwords](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/user_manual/en/session_management.html#managing-devices) or an `auth_command` — never a shared credential.
- **The GUI tray app autostarts at login** via `/etc/xdg/autostart/es.rgon.ncrs.desktop` and runs the systemctl service. 
- **Headless alternative**: `systemctl --user enable --now ncrs.service` runs the daemon without the GUI. The two coexist: when the GUI starts and finds the service already serving the IPC socket, it attaches as a client — mirroring sync state, errors, and transfers in the tray and forwarding pause/resume — instead of mounting a second time. Quitting an attached tray will unmount it, however.


## Advanced usage
Download the .deb and manually install it
```
cd Downloads
sudo apt install ./ncrs_*_amd64.deb
```
And open it from your applications list or the terminal `ncrs-gui & disown`

### Dependencies (shall be automatically requested by the .deb)
```sh
sudo apt-get install fuse3 libfuse3-dev libxdo-dev
```

### Development dependencies
The Rust toolchain: https://rustup.rs/

For the Nautilus extension (optional):
```sh
sudo apt-get install python3-nautilus
```

### Development running

**GUI + daemon** (the normal way):
```sh
./runui.sh
```
This starts the Tauri tray app; the daemon mounts WebDAV at your configured `mount_point` automatically. 

It will also install the shell integrations etc: `./shell_integration/file-managers/nautilus/install.sh` to show sync-state emblems (cloud = remote-only, tick = local) on files in the mount.

File-browser support is modular: the service detects which browsers are installed (Nautilus, Dolphin, Nemo) and applies each one's profile (indexer exclusion, thumbnails, type detection). Profiles can be toggled from the GUI's *File browsers* settings or with `ncrs-ctl integrations` / `ncrs-ctl integration-set <id> on|off|auto`. Adapters talk to the service over the protocol in [`shell_integration/file-managers/PROTOCOL.md`](shell_integration/file-managers/PROTOCOL.md); the Dolphin adapter lives in `shell_integration/file-managers/dolphin/`.

Downloaded files are cached in `~/.cache/ncrs/`.

**Daemon only** (headless / for systemd):
```sh
RUST_LOG=info cargo run -p ncrs_core
```

#### Uninstall extension:
```sh
rm ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions/syncstate.py
nautilus -q
```

### Running tests

Unit + integration tests (no server needed — integration tests skip gracefully):
```sh
cargo test
python3 -m unittest discover -s shell_integration/file-managers/nautilus -v
```

End-to-end tests against a real WebDAV server (requires Docker):
```sh
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
WEBDAV_TEST_URL=http://localhost:8888 cargo test -p ncrs_core --test integration_test
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down
```

Package build + verification (what CI runs; `--container` needs Docker or Podman):
```sh
./scripts/build-deb.sh              # options: --version, --arch, --out-dir, --skip-gui, --skip-build
./scripts/test-deb.sh --container   # metadata, contents, desktop entries, clean-install smoke test
```

## Cache and Storage Paths

ncrs stores locally-available files under `~/.cache/ncrs/<server-hash>/`:

| Directory | Purpose | Survives restart | User-controlled |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `kept/`   | Files explicitly pinned via "Keep Locally" | Yes | Yes (KEEP/EVICT) |
| `cache/`  | Files auto-downloaded during reads | Yes (validated on boot) | No (may be evicted) |

The `<server-hash>` component is derived from the WebDAV URL to allow multiple server configurations.

Additional metadata files in the root:
- `dir_cache.json` -- cached directory listings (etags + entries)
- `file_cache.json` -- tracks which files are cached/kept locally (remote path, etag, kept flag)
- `journal.bin` -- offline mutation journal for pending uploads/deletes/renames

Config options (in `~/.config/ncrs/config.yaml`):
- `auto_keep_locally_modified_files: true` -- keep a local copy after uploading a file you edited
- `auto_keep_cached_files: true` -- promote read-cached files to kept automatically
- `cache_max_size_bytes: 34359738368` -- max size for `cache/` directory (default 32 GB, 0 = unlimited). Oldest-accessed files are evicted first.
- `cache_auto_purge_days: 10` -- auto-delete cached files not accessed in N days (default 10, 0 = disabled)
- `cache_streamed_reads: true` -- promote fully-streamed files to disk cache
- `read_ahead_bytes: 67108864` -- read-ahead window for streaming reads (default 64 MB)
- `cache_cleanup_interval_secs: 3600` -- how often to run cache pruning (default 3600 = 1 hour)
- `dir_cache_max_stale_mins: 15` -- before showing a directory whose cached listing is older than this, ask the server whether it changed, so the first listing is already current (default 15, 0 = disabled). An unchanged directory costs one small etag request. Only applies while push notifications are down; while they work, a 24-hour backstop applies.
- `keep_paths: ["/Documents", "/Photos"]` -- remote paths to auto-keep locally on startup (default empty)
